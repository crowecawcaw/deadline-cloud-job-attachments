r"""
Exercises the Windows long-path helpers against a real filesystem.

The unit tests for `_get_long_path_compatible_path` patch `sys.platform`, so they pin
the *string construction* and nothing else. They cannot tell whether Windows actually
accepts the result. This script closes that gap: every assertion here is a real file
operation that either succeeds or raises OSError.

It is designed to be run twice on the same host, under two different interpreters:

  * a long-path-aware host (stock `python.exe`, which has declared `longPathAware`
    since CPython 3.6), and
  * a host that does *not* declare `longPathAware` (see
    `scripts/make_non_longpathaware_python.ps1`), standing in for the DCC executables
    and pywin32's `pythonservice.exe` that job attachments code actually runs inside.

On a host with the `LongPathsEnabled` registry setting ON, the second case is the one
the prefix exists for, and the one the pre-PR code skipped. `--require-host-unaware`
asserts we really are in that case before drawing any conclusion from it.

Usage:
    python scripted_tests/windows_long_path_probe.py --work-dir C:\japrobe
    python scripted_tests/windows_long_path_probe.py --work-dir C:\japrobe --unc-root \\localhost\jashare
    python scripted_tests/windows_long_path_probe.py --work-dir C:\japrobe --require-host-unaware
